. Component Architecture
a. High-Level Structure
Sidebar (Chat List): Shows all chat rooms (personal, group, etc.), search, and pinned chats.
Chat Window: Displays messages for the selected chat, with date separators, message bubbles, attachments, etc.
Header: Shows chat/user info, actions (profile, call, etc.).
Input Bar: For sending new messages, attachments, etc.

2. Data Fetching & State Management
a. Fetching Chats & Messages
On sidebar load, fetch chat rooms for the user (get_personal_chat_rooms).
On chat selection, fetch messages for that room (get_personal_messages).
b. State Management
Use React context or a state manager (Zustand, Redux, or React Context + useReducer) to:
Store chat rooms, selected chat, messages, loading/error states.
Allow optimistic UI updates (e.g., show sent message before backend confirms).
c. Caching & Pagination
Cache chat rooms and messages in memory (and optionally localStorage for fast reloads).
Implement message pagination (fetch latest N, load more on scroll up).
Use SWR/React Query for caching, background refetching, and stale-while-revalidate patterns.
3. Performance Considerations
Virtualized Message List: Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized for long message lists.
Batch Fetching: Fetch messages in batches/pages, not all at once.
Memoization: Memoize chat lists and message components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Debounced Search: Debounce chat search input to avoid excessive backend calls.
4. User Experience (UX) Enhancements
Loading States: Skeletons/placeholders for chat list and messages while loading.
Error Handling: Friendly error messages and retry options.
Scroll Management: Auto-scroll to bottom on new messages, but don’t disrupt user if they’re reading older messages.
Message Grouping: Group consecutive messages from the same sender, show date separators.
Optimistic UI: Show sent messages immediately, mark as “sending” until confirmed.
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management.
5. Scalability
Component Reusability: Design message bubbles, chat items, etc., as reusable components.
Separation of Concerns: Keep data fetching, state, and UI logic separate.
Backend Pagination: Ensure backend supports paginated message fetching for scalability.
6. Extensibility
Attachments: Plan for images, files, audio, etc.
Reactions/Replies: Design message model and UI to support future features.
Real-time Upgrade: Structure code so you can later add real-time updates (WebSockets, polling, or push).
7. Example Data Flow
Backend
UI
User
Backend
UI
User
Loads chat page
get_personal_chat_rooms(userId)
[chatRoom1, chatRoom2, ...]
Renders chat list
Clicks chatRoom1
get_personal_messages(chatRoom1Id)
[msg1, msg2, ...]
Renders messages
8. Suggested Libraries
State: Zustand, Redux, or React Context
Data Fetching: SWR, React Query
Virtualization: react-window, react-virtualized
UI: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, or your preferred component library
9. Next Steps
Scaffold the main components (Sidebar, ChatWindow, etc.).
Set up state management and data fetching hooks.
Implement chat list and message list with loading/error states.
Add pagination, caching, and virtualized lists.
Polish UX (scroll, grouping, optimistic UI, etc.).

1. Responsive Layout Strategy
a. Desktop (≥ md breakpoint)
Sidebar and Chat Window are both visible side-by-side (like your screenshot).
Sidebar on the left, chat window on the right.
b. Mobile (≤ sm breakpoint)
Only one panel visible at a time:
Default: Show the ChatSidebar (chat list).
When a chat is selected: Show the ChatWindow (messages for that chat).
Back button in the ChatWindow to return to the ChatSidebar.
2. Implementation Suggestions
a. State Management
Use a piece of state, e.g., selectedChatId, to determine which view to show.
On mobile, if selectedChatId is null, show the sidebar; otherwise, show the chat window.
b. CSS/Framework
Use CSS media queries or a utility framework like Tailwind CSS for responsive breakpoints.
Use hidden, block, or flex classes to show/hide panels based on screen size and state.
c. Example Pseudocode
Apply to plan.txt
>
isMobile can be determined using a custom hook (see below).
3. Detecting Mobile Devices
Use a custom React hook to detect screen size:
Apply to plan.txt
}
4. UX Details for Mobile
Back Button: In the chat window, show a back arrow at the top to return to the chat list.
Transitions: Use smooth transitions/animations when switching views.
Touch Targets: Make sure buttons and chat items are large enough for touch.
5. Accessibility
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
Use ARIA roles/labels for navigation and chat content.
Maintain focus order when switching between sidebar and chat window.
6. Summary Diagram
select chat
back button
Mobile: Chat List
Mobile: Chat Window
Desktop: Sidebar + Chat Window
In summary:
On desktop: show both panels.
On mobile: show one at a time, with a back button to switch.
Use state and responsive CSS to control visibility.

# OPTIC

We are proposing a fully on-chain chat application that embodies what chat rooms in web3 are suppose to look like.

## The Web3 Way

Optics is a chat and messaging application that allows users to go interact with each other in a decentralized and secure manner, while still earning from their interactions. Using our platform users can convert their local chat room into a decentralized investment pool accepting interval contributions from members. Based on stable coin and ckBTC pools available on ICPSwap an AI agent can then research and suggest an optimal liquidity pool for the group to invest in based on the market conditions, the group’s investment parameters, protocol features among others.

Once the withdrawal time limit of the groups reaches, the funds are withdrawn from the pool and the earnings split amongst the members according to their contributions and the cycle starts again. The contributions amount are not fixed but the chat room creator sets a max cap to avoid exploitation by a single member. In the future, a groups pooled funds can also offer members credit and earn from the interests as well.
Members are allowed to join other chat rooms(optic) as well and adhere to the rules set by the chat admin on that optic as well.
The user will also have their own dashboard where they can use the same agent to scheme through the pools available on ICPSwap and join or exit investment positions as they wish. Other developers will also be allowed o create plugin canisters that offer value to the user which the user can subscribe or pay a time fee for.

Our platform will have a couple of ways to generate revenue:

- Each chat room creation will cost a small fee and part of it will be used to fund the chat room’s canister with cycles.
- After every withdrawal from the pool the platform will charge a service fee based on the earnings.
- A fee will be charged on each plugin bough and the rest given to the plugin developer.
- User specific agent will be charged on a prompt basis.
